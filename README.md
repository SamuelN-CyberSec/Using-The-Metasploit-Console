# Using-The-Metasploit-Console
Metasploit console enables ethical hackers to simulate real world attack, identify vulnerabilities, and test defense. in this project i will demonstrate how to use key commands and configuration on Metasploit console effectively to strengthen security from an attacker perspective.Objective

# Objectives
- Start Metasploit console
- Utilizing search portscan
- Searching CVE on Metasploit console
- Setting target host for auxiliary scan 
- Accessing payloads 
- Setting Payloads



# Tools Used
-Kali Linux 
-VMware 


# Steps
-To start Metasploit console (msfconsole)
-To utilize search ports can to identify relevant port scanning auxiliary modules that can be use for network reconnaissance (search portscan)
-To search for CVE(Common Vulnerability Exposure) in the Metasploit console to find and load Metasploit module(search cve:<year>)
-To set target host for auxiliary scan to ensure accurate data collection during auxiliary scanning in Metasploit(to set,set RHOST <ip address>,to unset, unset RHOST <Ip address>)
-To access payload (show payload)
- Setting Payloads(search type payload name:ssh) after search  (set <number>)
